This is a forest scene with a spider main character. The objects I included in this scene are trees, cabin, spiders, snake, horse, birds, grass, rock. I made this scene because I always admire forests and cabin scenes in games and fantasy stories. The main character in this scene is the boss spider, who wanders around the terrain it reigns.
